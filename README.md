## Getting started

You have a few options for getting started with this repository.
The quickest way to get started is GitHub Codespaces, since it will setup everything for you, but you can also [set it up locally](#local-environment).

### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this repository virtually by using GitHub Codespaces. The button will open a web-based VS Code instance in your browser:

1. Open the repository (this may take several minutes):

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/python-agentframework-demos)

2. Open a terminal window
3. Continue with the steps to run the examples

### VS Code Dev Containers

A related option is VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
2. Open the project:

    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-agentframework-demos)

3. In the VS Code window that opens, once the project files show up (this may take several minutes), open a terminal window.
4. Continue with the steps to run the examples

The dev container includes a Redis server, which is used by the `agent_history_redis.py` example.

### Local environment

1. Make sure the following tools are installed:

    * [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    * Git

2. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-agentframework-demos
    cd python-agentframework-demos
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    uv sync
    ```

4. *Optional:* To run the `agent_history_redis.py` example, you need a Redis server running locally:

    ```shell
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
    ```

5. *Optional:* To run the PostgreSQL examples (`agent_knowledge_postgres.py`, `agent_knowledge_pg.py`, `agent_knowledge_pg_rewrite.py`), you need PostgreSQL with pgvector running locally:

    ```shell
    docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=LocalPasswordOnly pgvector/pgvector:pg17
    ```

## Configuring model providers

These examples can be run with Azure AI Foundry, OpenAI.com, or GitHub Models, depending on the environment variables you set. All the scripts reference the environment variables from a `.env` file, and an example `.env.sample` file is provided. Host-specific instructions are below.

## Using GitHub Models

If you open this repository in GitHub Codespaces, you can run the scripts for free using GitHub Models without any additional steps, as your `GITHUB_TOKEN` is already configured in the Codespaces environment.

If you want to run the scripts locally, you need to set up the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with a GitHub personal access token (PAT). You can create a PAT by following these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub account settings.
2. Click on "Developer settings" in the left sidebar.
3. Click on "Personal access tokens" in the left sidebar.
4. Click on "Tokens (classic)" or "Fine-grained tokens" depending on your preference.
5. Click on "Generate new token".
6. Give your token a name and select the scopes you want to grant. For this project, you don't need any specific scopes.
7. Click on "Generate token".
8. Copy the generated token.
9. Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable in your terminal or IDE:

    ```shell
    export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
    ```

10. Optionally, you can use a model other than "gpt-4.1-mini" by setting the `GITHUB_MODEL` environment variable. Use a model that supports function calling, such as: `gpt-5`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `o3-mini`, `AI21-Jamba-1.5-Large`, `AI21-Jamba-1.5-Mini`, `Codestral-2501`, `Cohere-command-r`, `Ministral-3B`, `Mistral-Large-2411`, `Mistral-Nemo`, `Mistral-small`

## Using Azure AI Foundry models

You can run all examples in this repository using GitHub Models. If you want to run the examples using models from Azure AI Foundry instead, you need to provision the Azure AI resources, which will incur costs.

This project includes infrastructure as code (IaC) to provision Azure OpenAI deployments of "gpt-4.1-mini" and "text-embedding-3-large" via Azure AI Foundry. The IaC is defined in the `infra` directory and uses the Azure Developer CLI to provision the resources.

1. Make sure the [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd) is installed.

2. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    For GitHub Codespaces users, if the previous command fails, try:

   ```shell
    azd auth login --use-device-code
    ```

    If you are using a tenant besides the default tenant, you may need to also login with Azure CLI to that tenant:

    ```shell
    az login --tenant your-tenant-id
    ```

3. Provision the OpenAI account:

    ```shell
    azd provision
    ```

    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "agents-demos"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location. Then it will provision the resources in your account.

4. Once the resources are provisioned, you should now see a local `.env` file with all the environment variables needed to run the scripts.
5. To delete the resources, run:

    ```shell
    azd down
    ```

## Using OpenAI.com models

1. Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.sample` file and updating it with your OpenAI API key and desired model name.

    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env
    ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your OpenAI API key and desired model name:

    ```bash
    API_HOST=openai
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
    ```

## Using the Aspire Dashboard for telemetry

The [agent_otel_aspire.py](examples/agent_otel_aspire.py) example can export OpenTelemetry traces, metrics, and structured logs to a [Aspire Dashboard](https://aspire.dev/dashboard/standalone/).

### In GitHub Codespaces / Dev Containers

The Aspire Dashboard runs automatically as a service alongside the dev container. No extra setup is needed.

1. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable is already set by the dev container.

2. Run the example:

    ```sh
    uv run examples/agent_otel_aspire.py
    ```

3. Open the dashboard at <http://localhost:18888> and explore:

    * **Traces**: See the full span tree — agent invocation → chat completion → tool execution
    * **Metrics**: View token usage and operation duration histograms
    * **Structured Logs**: Browse conversation messages (system, user, assistant, tool)
    * **GenAI visualizer**: Select a chat completion span to see the rendered conversation

### Local environment (without Dev Containers)

If you're running locally without Dev Containers, you need to start the Aspire Dashboard manually:

1. Start the Aspire Dashboard:

    ```sh
    docker run --rm -it -d -p 18888:18888 -p 4317:18889 --name aspire-dashboard \
        -e DASHBOARD__FRONTEND__AUTHMODE=Unsecured \
        mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:latest
    ```

2. Add the OTLP endpoint to your `.env` file:

    ```sh
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
    ```

3. Run the example:

    ```sh
    uv run agent_otel_aspire.py
    ```

4. Open the dashboard at <http://localhost:18888> and explore.

5. When done, stop the dashboard:

    ```shell
    docker stop aspire-dashboard
    ```

For the full Python + Aspire guide, see [Use the Aspire dashboard with Python apps](https://aspire.dev/dashboard/standalone-for-python/).

## Exporting telemetry to Azure Application Insights

The [agent_otel_appinsights.py](examples/agent_otel_appinsights.py) example exports OpenTelemetry traces, metrics, and structured logs to [Azure Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview).

### Setup

This example requires an `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable. You can get this automatically or manually:

**Option A: Automatic via `azd provision`**

If you run `azd provision` (see [Using Azure AI Foundry models](#using-azure-ai-foundry-models)), the Application Insights resource is provisioned automatically and the connection string is written to your `.env` file.

**Option B: Manual from the Azure Portal**

1. Create an Application Insights resource in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Copy the connection string from the resource's Overview page.
3. Add it to your `.env` file:

    ```sh
    APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=InstrumentationKey=...;IngestionEndpoint=...
    ```

### Running the example

```sh
uv run examples/agent_otel_appinsights.py
```

### Viewing telemetry

After running the example, navigate to your Application Insights resource in the Azure Portal:

* **Transaction search**: See end-to-end traces for agent invocations, chat completions, and tool executions.
* **Live Metrics**: Monitor real-time request rates and performance.
* **Performance**: Analyze operation durations and identify bottlenecks.

Telemetry data may take 2–5 minutes to appear in the portal.
